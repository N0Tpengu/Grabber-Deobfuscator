# Grabbers Deobfuscator

This repository contains some methods to disassemble and deobfuscate discord malwares (Blank, and others). It will give you the webhook and validate it if it found one.

## Usage
how to usilize
```cmd
install requirements by running 'setup.bat',
run 'Celestial.py'
```
I am Stupid and still dont get it
##Important
```cmd
you have to put the Grabber file in 'grabber deobfuscator main'
```

some grabbers like empyrean need python 3.10 so be sure to check the extractor warnings if there are.
**if you have an error with thiefcat deobfuscation, use python 3.11.4**


## TODO
